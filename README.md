# ES7-Releases

**What is ES/7?**

The Everytab System/7 aims to make DOS easier to use compared to typing commands

Head to releases to get the latest version.

An older version of the code is Open Source (es.bas)

ES/7 is not a fully fledged software, we try to make sure releases have less bugs, but don't expect it to be fully stable

Joi the discord server for more unstable betas.
